> ⍰ Thank you! In my current Cursor workspace, please generate a golang testsuite for a Unix 'wc' tool clone, then implement the application as well.

> ⓘ Sure! Below is a simple implementation of a Unix wc (word count) tool clone in Go, along with a test suite to verify its functionality.
> ## Go Application Implementation
```go
// path/to/wc.go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) < 2 {
        fmt.Println("Usage: wc <file>")
        return
    }

    fileName := os.Args[1]
    count, err := countWords(fileName)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }

    fmt.Printf("Word count: %d\n", count)
}

func countWords(fileName string) (int, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(fileName)
    if err != nil {
        return 0, err
    }
    defer file.Close()

    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
    wordCount := 0

    for scanner.Scan() {
        line := scanner.Text()
        wordCount += len(strings.Fields(line))
    }

    if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
        return 0, err
    }

    return wordCount, nil
}
```
> ## Go Test Suite
```go
// path/to/wc_test.go
package main

import (
    "os"
    "testing"
)

func TestCountWords(t *testing.T) {
    // Create a temporary file for testing
    tempFile, err := os.CreateTemp("", "testfile.txt")
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer os.Remove(tempFile.Name()) // Clean up

    // Write test content to the file
    content := "Hello World\nThis is a test file.\n"
    if _, err := tempFile.WriteString(content); err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }
    tempFile.Close()

    // Test the countWords function
    expected := 7
    actual, err := countWords(tempFile.Name())
    if err != nil {
        t.Fatal(err)
    }

    if actual != expected {
        t.Errorf("Expected %d, got %d", expected, actual)
    }
}
```
> ## Explanation
> 1. Application (wc.go):
> The main function checks for command-line arguments and calls countWords to count the words in the specified file.
> The countWords function reads the file line by line, counts the words using strings.Fields, and returns the total count.
> 2. Test Suite (wc_test.go):
> The test suite creates a temporary file with predefined content.
> It tests the countWords function to ensure it returns the correct word count.
> You can run the tests using the command:
```bash
go test path/to/
```
> Feel free to modify the implementation or tests as needed! If you have any specific requirements or additional features you'd like to include, let me know!
